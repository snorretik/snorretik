- 👋 Hi, I’m @snorretik
- 👀 I have a lot of interests currently, namely in: computer science, web development, game development, cyber security/ethical hacking but also applied mathematics for example and (still) data science/analysis.
- 🌱 I've been learning web development for quite a while now. I came from a hacking/security interest into the developing world. Been thinking of going back. Developing is a tough occupation I think. Struggle to find some inspiration sometimes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... No, nothing really. I'm mostly working/studying independantly for now, though I am conscious of the fact that you need to collaborate at some point with people to really be able to accomplish the (bigger) goals in life (or these area's of interest though/anyway).
- 📫 How to reach me, not sure yet. I have a personal website. But it's not interactive yet. Working on it. I'm guessing that github could have some message system as well, use that if possible. And if necessary you can contact me online through reddit as well, with my name "snorretik".
