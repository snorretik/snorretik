- 👋 Hi, I’m @snorretik
- 👀 I have several interests. In computer science, web development, game development, cyber security/ethical hacking but also applied mathematics for example and still data science/analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html/css/javascript through Odin, in order to complete that and then learn more about it in general through a hacking/security perspective. I'll do Math next to it though, *not kidding* for potential future job security (other type of security), I think Math will be/prove more durable instead of quickly changing technologies in computer science area's.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... No, nothing really. I'm mostly working/studying independantly for now, though I am conscious of the fact that you need to collaborate at some point with people to really be able to accomplish the (bigger) goals in life (or these area's of interest though/anyway).
- 📫 How to reach me, not sure yet. I have a personal website. But it's not interactive yet. Working on it. I'm guessing that github could have some message system as well, use that if possible. And if necessary you can contact me online through reddit as well, with my name "snorretik".
