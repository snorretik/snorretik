- 👋 Hi, I’m @snorretik
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html/css/javascript and are hopefully going to add php to that very soon
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more professional projects once I'm at that level, open source is what comes to mind.
- 📫 How to reach me, not sure yet. I have a personal website. But it's not interactive yet. Working on it. I'm guessing that github could have some message system as well, use that if possible. And if necessary you can contact me online through reddit as well, with my name "snorretik".
